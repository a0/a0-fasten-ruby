Run ruby code, shell code, or customized tasks in parallel using worker processes/threads. You can dynamically pause/continue/increase/decrease the number of tasks using our UI.

**WARNING** this is a Work In Progress project:
- features are still being implemented
- API could and will change

It has been released so people can try it and make feature requests, comments and suggestions.

## Feature Roadmap

### Task definitions:
- [x] define tasks from an YAML file
- [x] tasks definition can include shell code or eval'ed ruby code
- [x] tasks can also be defined with blocks of code, like RSpec.describe
- [x] tasks can have dependencies that are needed to reach a goal, similar to rake, make, and others

### Execution:
- [x] tasks are executed in parallel, using worker processes/threads
- [x] process are preferred on POSIX systems, otherwise threads are used
- [x] default number of jobs is the # of real cpu cores on the system
- [x] in case of task Error or Exception, the whole run will be stopped
- [x] runner saves a log file in `$(pwd)/fasten/log/runner/*name_of_runner*.log`
- [x] each task saves its STDERR/STDOUT to a log file in `$(pwd)/fasten/log/task/*name_of_task*.log`
- [x] once finished, statistics are saved in `$HOME/.fasten/stats/*name_of_runner*.csv`, which include: status (DONE, FAIL), duration, average, stdev, error and count
- [x] display a summary table of the execution

### UI/Curses
- [x] only available if the 'curses' gem is installed
- [x] Display number of jobs running, idle, waiting, and number of jobs (max)
- [x] Display current running tasks, pending tasks, waiting tasks, etc; showing which task is pending because other tasks need to be run first
- [x] Display the number of tasks done/pending
- [x] Display a progressbar
- [x] Display current local time
- [x] Pause whole runner with `P` key (waits current running tasks end)
- [x] Resume paused runner with `R` key
- [x] Press ‚¨ÖÔ∏è or ‚û°Ô∏è keys to dynamically increase/decrease number of jobs
- [ ] Use ‚¨ÜÔ∏è and ‚¨áÔ∏è to select tasks
- [ ] Calculate ETA, assuming all tasks take same time
- [x] Calculate ETA, based on saved tasks statistics
- [ ] Live tail -f of selected tasks

### UI/Console
- [x] Console is the default if STDOUT/STDIN is not a tty
- [x] Display each task as is being finished
- [ ] Calculate ETA, assuming all tasks take same time
- [ ] Calculate ETA, based on saved tasks statistics


### CLI
- [x] provides a CLI for running *_fasten.rb ruby code


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here. Right now, check spec directory for sample code.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
